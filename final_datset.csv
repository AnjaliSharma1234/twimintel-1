In May, Toss said that it would more than quadruple its existing 250 billion won in capital to 1.2 trillion won in three years. The FSC pointed out that Toss had lost 44.5 billion won in 2018, implying that a company so deep in the red may not easily raise such a large sum of money.

As an encrypted distributed machine learning framework, FL can tackle both problems by allowing different parties to build models collaboratively without the need to reveal their data. The method helps to advance AI modeling while protecting data and privacy.

This grants a ready-to-use FL framework tool to any companies wishing to work together.

Currently, data silos and privacy protection are two big challenges for AI. As an encrypted distributed machine learning framework, FL can tackle both problems by allowing different parties to build models collaboratively without the need to reveal their data. The method helps to advance AI modeling while protecting data and privacy.

Professor Qiang Yang, WeBanks chief AI officer, explained that large-scale AI application relies on big data, which is scattered across many different organizations. Direct data merging will violate privacy regulations.

In 2015, MYbank pioneered the 310 model for SMEs, which has enabled financial institutions in China to leverage proprietary risk management technologies so they can provide collateral-free business loans to SMEs. Not only has it enabled access to capital for SMEs, but they can apply for a loan simply by using their mobile phone, highlighting the ease and convenience of the model. Furthermore, as the name suggests, 3-1-0 lending enables borrowers to complete their online loan applications in three minutes, obtain approval in one second and with zero human intervention.

On June 21, 2018, MYbank announced Star Plan which aimed to use technology to enable 1,000 financial institution partners to provide more cost-effective financing services to 30 million SMEs in China within a three-year period. As of September 2019, the 310 model has enabled MYbank and its over 400 financial institution partners to serve at least 20 million SMEs. Leveraging proprietary risk management technologies, MYbank helps keep the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio for the SME business loans offered through the 310 model at around 1%. As of June 2019, the size of each loan provided by MYbank was around RMB 10,000 (USD 1,400), reflecting the specific needs of SMEs, many of whom are roadside vendors, mom-and-pop shops and individual business operators with no more than five employees.

China's traditional lenders have weak digital capabilities and like many banks globally, prefer lending to customers with excellent credit. Before internet finance took off, that prevented many Chinese from getting loans through the traditional financial system.

As an encrypted distributed machine learning framework, FL can tackle both problems by allowing different parties to build models collaboratively without the need to reveal their data. The method helps to advance AI modeling while protecting data and privacy.

This grants a ready-to-use FL framework tool to any companies wishing to work together.
