In 2015, MYbank pioneered the “310 model” for SMEs, which has enabled financial institutions in China to leverage proprietary risk management technologies so they can provide collateral-free business loans to SMEs. Not only has it enabled access to capital for SMEs, but they can apply for a loan simply by using their mobile phone, highlighting the ease and convenience of the model. Furthermore, as the name suggests, 3-1-0 lending enables borrowers to complete their online loan applications in three minutes, obtain approval in one second and with zero human intervention.

Affordable banking services provided by the digital finance duopoly of Alibaba and Tencent have helped millions of individual Chinese and small businesses gain access to credit that traditional lenders would never have extended to them. In Tencent's case, its WeBank has performed a rare feat for a fintech: It has quickly become profitable (in under five years), built tremendous scale and largely escaped the ire of regulators.",valid,,

How did WeBank manage to succeed so quickly? The answer is multifold. To begin, China's unique market conditions provided WeBank fertile ground on which to grow. China's traditional lenders have weak digital capabilities and like many banks globally, prefer lending to customers with excellent credit. Before internet finance took off, that prevented many Chinese from getting loans through the traditional financial system. When WeBank and the Alibaba counterpart MyBank opened for business, they had a huge hungry customer base awaiting them.",valid,,

The FSC had different reasons for saying no to the applicants. In the case of Toss, a peer-to-peer money transfer app owned by Korean fintech unicorn Viva Republica, the FSC worried about the ownership structure of Toss Bank and its funding capabilities.",valid,,

That's why it makes sense for Toss Bank to team up with a big financial services incumbent: Show the FSC that ""fin"" is in the driver's seat, not ""tech."" In mid-October, Korea media reported that Standard Chartered Bank Korea had joined Toss's consortium, although with only a single-digit stake.",valid,,

In contrast, the only major tech company is Viva Republica, which holds a 34% stake. That's the largest of any single company overall, but down from over 60% when Toss first applied for an internet banking license in May. By reducing Viva Republica's stake by 26%, the company has restructured its shareholders in a way that should help to assuage the FSC's concerns.",valid,,

In May, Toss said that it would more than quadruple its existing 250 billion won in capital to 1.2 trillion won in three years. The FSC pointed out that Toss had lost 44.5 billion won in 2018, implying that a company so deep in the red may not easily raise such a large sum of money. Big losses incurred by  Europe's largest challenger banks have not deterred their backers from doubling down, but such an argument is unlikely to persuade the conservative FSC.",valid,,
